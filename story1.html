<p>In a small village, there lived a potter. He had a donkey. Every day his donkey
    would carry soil from the field to his house. Since the field was quite far off, the
    potter would rest under a tree midway, tying his donkey nearby.
</p>
<p>One day, the potter forgot to take the rope with which he tied the donkey
        every day. When he reached the tree, he thought, how do I tie this donkey today? It
        might run away if I sleep. The potter decided to hold the donkey's ears so that the
        donkey would not run away and he could sleep.
</p>
<p>A saint, who passed that way, saw the potter holding on the donkey's ears.
    Then the saint wanted to know what the problem of the potter was. When the potter
    told the saint what the problem was, the wise saint said, Take the donkey to the
    place where you tie him every day. Pretend to tie it an imaginary rope. I assure you it
    won't run away. The potter did what the saint had said.
</p>
<p>He left the donkey and went to take a nap. When he woke up, he found the
    donkey standing in the same place. The potter prepared to leave for home. But the
    donkey did not move. The potter was confused and he saw the wise saint again. He
    ran up to the saint and told him about the donkey's behaviour. The saint said you
    tied up the donkey, but did you untie him? Go and pretend to untie the rope with
    which you had tied the donkey. The potter followed the saint's advice.
</p>
<p>
    Now the donkey was ready to leave for home. The potter thanked the wise
saint and went home happily.
