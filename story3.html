<p>
    Once a wolf killed a lamb and started eating it. Suddenly a piece of bone stuck
in its throat. It cried out of pain and called for help. There came a crane. The wolf
lured the crane that if you take the bone outside, I will give a lot of rewards.
</p>
<p>
    The greedy crane immediately agreed, removed the piece of bone with its
long nose. The wolf was relieved of its pain. Then the crane asked for the rewards
</p>
<p>
    The wolf laughed at the crane and said, "I have already rewarded you without
biting your head. Run away from here, else I will kill you". The crane was very much
disappointed and ran way to save its life.
